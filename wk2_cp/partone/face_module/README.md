# Simple Python Project Template

The basics of creating an installable Python package.

To install this package first activate the appropriate conda environment, then, in the same directory as `setup.py` run the command:

```shell
pip install -e .
```

This will install `example_project` in your Python environment as an "editable" installation (hence the `-e`). This means that you can edit the project's source files, and those changes will manifest without you needing to reinstall `example_project`. You can now use it as:

```python
from example_project import returns_one
from example_project.functions_a import hello_world
from example_project.functions_b import multiply_and_sum
```

To change then name of the project, do the following:
   - change the name of the directory `example_project/` to your project's name (it must be a valid python variable name, e.g. no spaces allowed)
   - change the `PROJECT_NAME` in `setup.py` to the same name
   - install this new package (`pip install -e .`)

If you changed the name to, say, `my_proj`, then the usage will be:

```python
from my_proj import returns_one
from my_proj.functions_a import hello_world
from my_proj.functions_b import multiply_and_sum
```
