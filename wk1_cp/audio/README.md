# Audio Dataprocessing
This program should work regardless of your OS. Please let David Yang know if it doesn't.

```c++
You are receiving a numpy array of a 3-element numpy array tuple (ndarray, ndarray, ndarray) 
where the spectrogram values have been log10ed.
The tuple is in the format (Spectrogram, Frequencies, Times)
```

## Procedures ‚≠ê
1. call 'from audio import functions '
2. call 'functions.TheFunctionYouWantToCall'
3. You can look at the jupyter notebook for guidance. 
If you just want the pickled 1gb spectrogram files(not recommended)
you can build from dataproc.ipynb
